# PvP System Security Documentation

## Overview

This document outlines the security measures, vulnerabilities addressed, and best practices for the Protocol Guardians PvP system.

## Security Audit Status

**Status**: Pre-audit

**Recommended Actions**:
- Conduct formal security audit before mainnet deployment
- Use bug bounty program for additional security testing
- Monitor for known vulnerabilities in dependencies

## Security Measures Implemented

### 1. Access Control

#### Ownable Pattern
All critical admin functions use OpenZeppelin's `Ownable` contract:

- Only owner can modify fees
- Only owner can pause contract functionality
- Only owner can withdraw protocol fees
- Owner transferability for multi-sig compatibility

#### Admin Functions Protected
```solidity
modifier onlyOwner() {
    require(msg.sender == owner(), "Not authorized");
    _;
}
```

### 2. Reentrancy Protection

All payment functions use `ReentrancyGuard`:

- `acceptChallenge()`: Prevents reentrancy during wager distribution
- `cancelChallenge()`: Prevents reentrancy during refund
- `withdrawFees()`: Prevents reentrancy during fee withdrawal
- `emergencyWithdraw()`: Prevents reentrancy during emergency withdrawals

**Pattern**: Checks-Effects-Interactions
```solidity
// 1. Check conditions
require(balance >= amount, "Insufficient balance");

// 2. Update state
balances[msg.sender] -= amount;

// 3. External call
payable(msg.sender).transfer(amount);
```

### 3. Signature Verification

#### ECDSA Signature Security
- All NFT stats signed with ECDSA signatures
- Signed message includes tokenId, stats array, and expiration
- Signer address verified against known backend address
- Signatures expire after 1 hour (prevents replay attacks)

```solidity
function _verifyStatsSignature(SignedStats memory signedStats) internal view returns (bool) {
    // Recover signer from signature
    bytes32 messageHash = keccak256(abi.encodePacked(
        signedStats.tokenId,
        signedStats.stats,
        signedStats.expiration
    ));
    
    bytes32 ethSignedMessageHash = keccak256(abi.encodePacked(
        "\x19Ethereum Signed Message:\n32",
        messageHash
    ));
    
    address signer = recoverSigner(ethSignedMessageHash, signedStats.signature);
    
    return signer == signerAddress && block.timestamp < signedStats.expiration;
}
```

### 4. Input Validation

#### Comprehensive Checks
- Address zero validation
- Formation size validation (must be 1, 3, or 5)
- Username length validation (1-32 characters)
- Avatar URL length validation (0-500 characters)
- Stats array length validation
- NFT ownership verification
- Balance sufficient checks

```solidity
require(opponent != address(0), "Invalid opponent address");
require(formation.length == battleType, "Invalid formation size");
require(bytes(username).length > 0, "Username cannot be empty");
require(bytes(username).length <= 32, "Username too long");
require(address(this).balance >= amount, "Insufficient balance");
```

### 5. Pausability

#### Granular Pause Control
- Separate pause flags for ranking and wager challenges
- Owner can pause without affecting contract state
- Existing challenges unaffected by pause
- Emergency response capability

```solidity
modifier whenNotPaused(uint8 pauseType) {
    require(!pauseStatuses[pauseType], "Function paused");
    _;
}
```

### 6. Randomness Security

#### Block-Based Randomness
Battles use blockchain randomness:
- `block.timestamp` for temporal randomness
- `block.prevrandao` for unpredictable seed
- Combined for battle randomness
- Not manipulable by miners in practice (low value)

```solidity
uint256 seed = uint256(keccak256(abi.encodePacked(
    block.timestamp,
    block.prevrandao,
    challengeId
)));
```

### 7. Gas Optimization and DoS Protection

#### Loop Limits
- Maximum turn limit (50 turns) prevents infinite loops
- Formation size limited to 5 cards maximum
- Matchmaking pool returns max 10 opponents

#### Efficient Storage
- Packed structs where possible
- External functions reduce contract size
- Events used for efficient querying

## Known Limitations

### 1. Centralized Signature Service

**Risk**: Backend signer is a central point of failure

**Mitigation**:
- Signer address can be updated by owner
- Rate limiting on backend
- Signature expiration prevents replay
- Multiple signer addresses can be configured (future enhancement)

### 2. Off-Chain Stat Verification

**Risk**: Stats come from off-chain metadata

**Mitigation**:
- ECDSA signature verification
- Only trusted backend can sign
- Stats are immutable from NFT metadata
- Frontend validates before sending to contract

### 3. Randomness Manipulation

**Risk**: Miners could theoretically manipulate randomness

**Mitigation**:
- Low value per battle (not economically viable to manipulate)
- Multiple randomness sources combined
- Turn-based combat reduces impact of minor manipulation

### 4. Formation Sniping

**Risk**: Players could monitor formations and counter-pick

**Mitigation**:
- Formations locked during pending challenges
- Cannot see opponent formation before challenge accepted
- ELO-based matchmaking reduces skill advantage

## Vulnerability Categories

### Critical Vulnerabilities

**None currently identified**

### High Severity

**1. ERC20 Token Transfer Fees**

**Issue**: Some ERC20 tokens have transfer fees that would break wager distribution

**Mitigation**: 
- Documentation states only tokens without fees are supported
- Consider whitelist of supported tokens

**Future Enhancement**: Add fee detection before token transfers

### Medium Severity

**1. Gas Griefing**

**Issue**: Large formations (5v5) could be expensive to execute

**Mitigation**:
- Clear documentation of gas costs
- User must execute challenge acceptance (accepts gas risk)
- Can cancel challenge if opponent accepts

**2. ELO Inflation**

**Issue**: Wager battles don't affect ELO, but ranking battles do

**Mitigation**:
- Separate ELO tracking for ranked battles only
- Clear documentation of ELO system

### Low Severity

**1. Front Running**

**Issue**: Challenges could be front-run

**Mitigation**:
- Accept/reject is atomic
- No benefit to front-running
- Gas cost prevents most attacks

**2. Metadata Manipulation**

**Issue**: If IPFS metadata changed, stats would change

**Mitigation**:
- IPFS content is immutable by design
- Signature prevents replay of old stats

## Best Practices

### For Developers

1. **Always verify signatures before trusting stats**
2. **Check formation size matches battle type**
3. **Validate NFT ownership before accepting challenges**
4. **Use events for off-chain indexing**
5. **Test with multiple card combinations**

### For Users

1. **Verify challenge details before accepting**
2. **Check formation before creating challenge**
3. **Ensure sufficient gas for battle execution**
4. **Monitor contract events for transparency**
5. **Report suspicious activity to administrators**

### For Administrators

1. **Use multi-sig for owner wallet**
2. **Monitor contract for unusual activity**
3. **Regularly audit accumulated fees**
4. **Keep signer private key secure**
5. **Test upgrades thoroughly before deploying**

## Incident Response Plan

### If Vulnerability Discovered

1. **Pause Contracts**: Immediately pause affected functionality
2. **Assess Impact**: Determine scope of vulnerability
3. **Notify Users**: Alert community of potential issues
4. **Develop Fix**: Create patched version
5. **Security Audit**: Have fix audited before deployment
6. **Deploy Fix**: Migrate users to new contract
7. **Post-Mortem**: Document lessons learned

### If Funds Compromised

1. **Freeze Contracts**: Pause all operations
2. **Assess Damage**: Calculate total losses
3. **Coordinate with Exchanges**: Freeze related accounts
4. **Law Enforcement**: Report to appropriate authorities
5. **Compensation Plan**: Develop user compensation if applicable

## Testing Recommendations

### Security Testing

1. **Fuzz Testing**: Test with random inputs
2. **Invariant Testing**: Verify system invariants
3. **Reentrancy Testing**: Attempt reentrancy attacks
4. **Overflow Testing**: Test with maximum values
