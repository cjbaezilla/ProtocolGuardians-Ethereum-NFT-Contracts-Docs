## Family Synergy

### Same Family Bonuses
When multiple Guardians of the same family are in a party, they receive synergy bonuses:

```javascript
function calculateFamilySynergy(party) {
  const familyCounts = {};
  party.forEach(guardian => {
    familyCounts[guardian.family] = (familyCounts[guardian.family] || 0) + 1;
  });
  
  const maxFamilyCount = Math.max(...Object.values(familyCounts));
  const totalGuardians = party.length;
  
  return (maxFamilyCount / totalGuardians) * 3; // 3% per 100% same family
}
```

### Family Combinations
Different family combinations provide unique strategic advantages:

| Combination | Bonus | Description |
|-------------|-------|-------------|
| **Guardians + Beasts** | +5% Defense, +3% Power | Balanced offense/defense |
| **Mechanicals + Elementals** | +4% Mana, +3% Critical | Magical precision |
| **Dragons + Ancients** | +6% Power, +4% Wisdom | Ultimate strength |
| **Chaos + Void** | +5% Luck, +3% Critical | Unpredictable power |
| **All 8 Families** | +10% all stats | Ultimate diversity bonus |

## Strategic Implications

### Family Selection Strategy

- **Elementals**: Magical play, elemental mastery
- **Chaos**: High-risk play, unpredictable outcomes

- **Ancients**: Strategic play, wisdom-based approaches
- **Void**: Control play, existence manipulation

### Party Composition
- **Single Family**: Maximum synergy bonuses, focused strategy
- **Mixed Families**: Versatility, multiple strategic options
- **Complementary Families**: Balanced approach, covering weaknesses

### Ability Access
- **Higher Rarity**: Access to more powerful family abilities

- **Diversity**: Access to multiple family abilities

## Implementation Examples

### Example 1: Family Synergy Calculation
```javascript
// Party: 3x Guardians, 1x Beasts, 1x Mechanicals
const party = [
  { family: 'Guardians' },
  { family: 'Guardians' },
  { family: 'Guardians' },
  { family: 'Beasts' },
  { family: 'Mechanicals' }
];

const familyCounts = {
  'Guardians': 3,
  'Beasts': 1,
  'Mechanicals': 1
};

const maxFamilyCount = 3; // Guardians
const totalGuardians = 5;

const familySynergy = (3 / 5) * 3; // 1.8% bonus
```

### Example 2: Family Ability Access
```javascript
// Check if Guardian can learn family ability
function canLearnFamilyAbility(guardian, ability) {
  const familyLevels = {
    'Common': 0,
    'Uncommon': 1,
    'Rare': 2,
    'Epic': 3,
    'Legendary': 4,
    'Mythic': 5,
    'Transcendent': 6
  };
  
  const guardianLevel = familyLevels[guardian.rarity];
  const abilityLevel = ability.minRarityLevel;
  
  return guardian.family === ability.family && guardianLevel >= abilityLevel;
}
```

### Example 3: Optimal Family Composition
```javascript
// Mission: High damage required, defensive capabilities needed
// Recommended: 2x Dragons + 2x Guardians + 1x Beasts

const recommendedParty = [
  { family: 'Dragons', abilities: ['DRAGON\'S FURY', 'ANCIENT WISDOM'] },
  { family: 'Dragons', abilities: ['DRAGON\'S FURY', 'ANCIENT WISDOM'] },
  { family: 'Guardians', abilities: ['GUARDIAN\'S WARD', 'PROTECTIVE AURA'] },
  { family: 'Guardians', abilities: ['GUARDIAN\'S WARD', 'PROTECTIVE AURA'] },
  { family: 'Beasts', abilities: ['HUNTER\'S INSTINCT', 'PREDATOR\'S FURY'] }
];

// This party provides:
// - High damage output (Dragons + Beasts)
// - Defensive capabilities (Guardians)
// - Family synergy bonuses
// - Balanced ability coverage
```
