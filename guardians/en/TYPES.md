## Strategic Implications

### Type Advantage in Expeditions

When a party contains a type that has advantage over the mission's type, the party receives a 15% bonus to their effective stats for success rate calculation.

```javascript
function calculateTypeAdvantage(party, mission) {
  const partyTypes = party.map(guardian => guardian.type);
  const missionType = mission.type;
  
  let hasAdvantage = false;
  for (const type of partyTypes) {
    if (getTypeAdvantage(type, missionType) > 1.0) {
      hasAdvantage = true;
      break;
    }
  }
  
  return hasAdvantage ? 15 : 0; // 15% bonus if advantageous
}
```

### Party Composition Strategies

#### Balanced Approach
- **Composition**: 1 of each type
- **Advantages**: Type coverage, versatility
- **Disadvantages**: No type synergy bonuses

#### Type Synergy Approach
- **Composition**: 3-4 of same type + 1-2 others
- **Advantages**: Type synergy bonuses, focused strategy
- **Disadvantages**: Vulnerable to type disadvantages

#### Counter-Strategy Approach
- **Composition**: Types chosen to counter specific mission types
- **Advantages**: Maximum type advantage
- **Disadvantages**: Limited versatility

### Type Synergy Bonuses

When multiple Guardians of the same type are in a party, they receive synergy bonuses:

```javascript
function calculateTypeSynergy(party) {
  const typeCounts = {};
  party.forEach(guardian => {
    typeCounts[guardian.type] = (typeCounts[guardian.type] || 0) + 1;
  });
  
  const maxTypeCount = Math.max(...Object.values(typeCounts));
  const totalGuardians = party.length;
  
  return (maxTypeCount / totalGuardians) * 5; // 5% per 100% same type
}
```

## Type-Specific Abilities

### Universal Abilities
All types can learn universal abilities, but some types are more suited to certain ability categories:

- **Galactic**: Speed and Mana abilities
- **Cosmic**: Luck and Mana abilities
- **Celestial**: Power and Mana abilities
- **Mechanical**: Defense and Stamina abilities
- **Dragon**: Power and HP abilities
- **Beast**: Speed and Power abilities
- **Elemental**: Mana and Critical abilities
- **Chaos**: Critical and Luck abilities

### Family Signature Abilities
Each type belongs to a family that has exclusive signature abilities:

- **Galactic** → **Guardians Family**: Protective abilities
- **Cosmic** → **Ancients Family**: Wisdom abilities
- **Celestial** → **Guardians Family**: Divine abilities
- **Mechanical** → **Mechanicals Family**: System abilities
- **Dragon** → **Dragons Family**: Fury abilities
- **Beast** → **Beasts Family**: Hunt abilities
- **Elemental** → **Elementals Family**: Element abilities
- **Chaos** → **Chaos Family**: Chaos abilities

## Implementation Examples

### Example 1: Type Advantage Calculation

```javascript
// Party: 2x Galactic, 1x Cosmic, 1x Mechanical, 1x Dragon
// Mission: Cosmic-type mission

const party = [
  { type: 'Galactic' },
  { type: 'Galactic' },
  { type: 'Cosmic' },
  { type: 'Mechanical' },
  { type: 'Dragon' }
];

const mission = { type: 'Cosmic' };

// Galactic > Cosmic, so party has type advantage
const typeAdvantage = 15; // 15% bonus to effective stats
```

### Example 2: Type Synergy Calculation

```javascript
// Same party as above
const typeCounts = {
  'Galactic': 2,
  'Cosmic': 1,
  'Mechanical': 1,
  'Dragon': 1
};

const maxTypeCount = 2; // Galactic
const totalGuardians = 5;

const typeSynergy = (2 / 5) * 5; // 2% bonus
```

### Example 3: Optimal Party Selection

```javascript
// Mission: Dragon-type, requires high Power and HP
// Recommended party: 2x Dragon + 2x Beast + 1x Elemental

const recommendedParty = [
  { type: 'Dragon', stats: { power: 3000, hp: 2500 } },
  { type: 'Dragon', stats: { power: 2800, hp: 2400 } },
  { type: 'Beast', stats: { power: 2000, speed: 2500 } },
  { type: 'Beast', stats: { power: 1900, speed: 2300 } },
  { type: 'Elemental', stats: { power: 1800, mana: 2000 } }
];

// This party has:
// - High Power (Dragon advantage)
// - Type advantage (Beast > Dragon)
// - Balanced stats for mission requirements
```

## Balance Considerations

### Type Balance
- No single type dominates all stats
- Each type has clear strengths and weaknesses
- Type advantages are meaningful but not overwhelming

### Strategic Depth
- Type selection matters for party composition
- Type advantages create meaningful choices
- Synergy bonuses encourage focused strategies

### Accessibility
- All types are viable in different contexts
- No type is completely useless
- Clear strengths and weaknesses for strategic planning

## Future Considerations

### Planned Features
- **Type Evolution**: Guardians may evolve between types
- **Type Fusion**: Combine types for hybrid abilities
- **Type Mastery**: Specialization bonuses for focused play

### Balance Updates
- **Type Effectiveness**: May be adjusted based on gameplay data
- **Stat Distributions**: Fine-tuning based on performance
- **New Types**: Potential addition of new types in future expansions
