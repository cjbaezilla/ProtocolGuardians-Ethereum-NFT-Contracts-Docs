## Combat System

### Turn Order

Cards attack in order of **Speed** stat:
- Higher Speed = Attacks first
- Same Speed = Random order
- Teams alternate turns until one is defeated

### Damage Calculation

**Base Formula**:
```
damage = attacker.power - (defender.defense / 2)
minimum_damage = 1
```

**Type Advantages**:
- Type advantage: +15% damage bonus
- Type disadvantage: -15% damage penalty
- No advantage: Normal damage

**Critical Hits**:
- Chance = critical_stat / 1000 (base 1000 system)
- Example: 250 critical = 25% critical chance (250/1000 = 0.25)
- Critical hits do 2x damage
- Random value ranges from 0-1000, compared directly against critical stat

**Dodge/Evasion**:
- Chance = luck_stat / 1000 (base 1000 system)
- Example: 150 luck = 15% dodge chance (150/1000 = 0.15)
- Successful dodge = 0 damage taken
- Random value ranges from 0-1000, compared directly against luck stat

### Win Conditions

**Victory**:
- All opponent cards have HP ‚â§ 0
- Must eliminate entire enemy team

**Turn Limit**:
- Maximum 50 turns per battle
- After 50 turns, team with most total HP wins
- No ties (winner always determined)

### Card Types

Protocol Guardians features 8 distinct types with a circular advantage system:

**Type Wheel** (each type beats one type and is weak to another):
- **Galactic ‚≠ê** beats **Cosmic üåå** (weak to **Chaos üíÄ**)
- **Cosmic üåå** beats **Celestial ‚òÑÔ∏è** (weak to **Galactic ‚≠ê**)
- **Celestial ‚òÑÔ∏è** beats **Mechanical ü§ñ** (weak to **Cosmic üåå**)
- **Mechanical ü§ñ** beats **Dragon üêâ** (weak to **Celestial ‚òÑÔ∏è**)
- **Dragon üêâ** beats **Beast ü¶Å** (weak to **Mechanical ü§ñ**)
- **Beast ü¶Å** beats **Elemental üî•** (weak to **Dragon üêâ**)
- **Elemental üî•** beats **Chaos üíÄ** (weak to **Beast ü¶Å**)
- **Chaos üíÄ** beats **Galactic ‚≠ê** (weak to **Elemental üî•**)

**Type Effectiveness:**
- Type advantage: +15% damage bonus
- Type disadvantage: -15% damage penalty
- No advantage/disadvantage: Normal damage (100%)

## Gameplay Tips

### Formation Strategy

1. **Balance Your Team**: Mix high damage, high defense, and high speed
2. **Type Coverage**: Include different card types to counter various opponents
3. **Speed Matters**: Faster cards attack first and more often
4. **HP is King**: Survive longer to deal more damage

### Offensive Tips

- High Power + Low Defense = Glass cannon (high risk, high reward)
- Balance Power and Defense for consistency
- Critical chance adds burst damage
- Speed determines who strikes first

### Defensive Tips

- High Defense reduces incoming damage
- Luck gives you chances to completely dodge
- HP is your resource to manage
- High Defense + High HP = Tank builds

### Strategic Tips

1. Know your opponent's ELO before accepting
2. Check their win/loss ratio if available
3. For wagers: Only bet what you can afford to lose
4. Practice with ranking battles before large wagers
5. Monitor gas prices when accepting challenges
