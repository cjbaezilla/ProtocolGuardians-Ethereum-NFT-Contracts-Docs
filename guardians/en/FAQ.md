## Gameplay Questions

### How do expeditions work?
Expeditions are on-chain missions where you send 1-5 Guardians to complete tasks and earn rewards. Success depends on your party's stats, type advantages, luck, and party synergy. Higher difficulty missions offer better rewards but require stronger parties.

### What are the different difficulty levels?
- **Beginner** (30 min): 5,000 stats required, 50 tokens base reward
- **Novice** (2 hours): 10,000 stats required, 150 tokens base reward
- **Adept** (6 hours): 15,000 stats required, 400 tokens base reward
- **Expert** (12 hours): 20,000 stats required, 1,000 tokens base reward
- **Master** (24 hours): 25,000 stats required, 3,000 tokens base reward

### How do I calculate expedition success rate?
Success rate = 50% (base) + stats bonus + type advantage + luck bonus + party synergy
- **Stats bonus**: Up to 45% based on how much your party exceeds requirements
- **Type advantage**: 15% if your party has type advantage over mission
- **Luck bonus**: 0.01% per total party Luck stat
- **Party synergy**: 5% if all party members are same type

### Can I stake Guardians while they're on expeditions?
No, Guardians cannot be staked while on expeditions. This creates strategic decisions about resource allocation - you must choose between passive staking income or active expedition rewards.

### What are the different types and how do they work?
There are 8 types with a circular advantage system:
- **Galactic** ‚≠ê > **Cosmic** üåå > **Celestial** ‚òÑÔ∏è > **Mechanical** ü§ñ > **Dragon** üêâ > **Beast** ü¶Å > **Elemental** üî• > **Chaos** üíÄ > **Galactic** ‚≠ê

Each type has unique stat distributions and strategic advantages.

### What are families and how do they differ from types?
Families are thematic groupings that provide exclusive signature abilities:
- **Guardians**: Protective abilities
- **Beasts**: Hunt and instinct abilities
- **Mechanicals**: System and efficiency abilities
- **Elementals**: Elemental mastery abilities
- **Chaos**: Unpredictable abilities
- **Dragons**: Power and treasure abilities
- **Ancients**: Wisdom and knowledge abilities
- **Void**: Nullification abilities

### How do abilities work?
Guardians have 3 abilities that provide strategic advantages in expeditions and staking. Abilities have cooldowns and can only be used by Guardians of the appropriate rarity and family. Higher rarity Guardians have access to more powerful abilities.

### What are the different rarities?
- **Common** (40% supply): 4,000-5,000 stats, 1.0x multiplier
- **Uncommon** (25% supply): 5,500-6,500 stats, 1.5x multiplier
- **Rare** (15% supply): 7,000-8,000 stats, 2.0x multiplier
- **Epic** (10% supply): 8,500-9,500 stats, 2.5x multiplier

- **Transcendent** (1% supply): 12,000-14,000 stats, 4.0x multiplier

### How do I form the best party for expeditions?
Consider these factors:
- **Stats**: Ensure your party meets mission requirements
- **Type advantages**: Use types that have advantage over mission type
- **Party synergy**: Same-type parties get bonus success rate
- **Abilities**: Coordinate abilities for maximum effect
- **Rarity**: Higher rarity Guardians provide better rewards

### What happens if my expedition fails?
Failed expeditions provide no rewards, but your Guardians still enter cooldown. This creates risk/reward decisions - higher difficulty missions offer better rewards but have higher failure rates.

### How long do Guardians need to rest after expeditions?
Cooldown duration equals mission duration:
- **Beginner**: 30 minutes
- **Novice**: 2 hours
- **Adept**: 6 hours
- **Expert**: 12 hours
- **Master**: 24 hours

### Can I use abilities to reduce cooldowns?
Yes, certain abilities like "TIME DILATION" and "TEMPORAL MASTERY" can reduce cooldown durations, allowing for more frequent expeditions.
