## Implementation Notes

1. **Percentage Allocation**: Each type's stat distribution is calculated as percentages of the total stat pool for that rarity tier.

2. **Rarity Scaling**: The total stat pool increases with rarity, but the percentage distribution remains consistent within each type.

3. **Balance Considerations**: No single type dominates all stats, ensuring diverse party compositions are viable.

4. **Thematic Consistency**: Stat distributions reflect the thematic nature of each type, making gameplay feel authentic to the lore.

5. **Expedition Optimization**: Different stat profiles excel in different expedition types, encouraging strategic party building.
